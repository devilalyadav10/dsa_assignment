# DSA Assignment Repository

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for the **Data Structures and Algorithms (COMP202)** Assignment #2, June 2025. It includes C programs and their corresponding documentation for eight programming tasks, implemented as per the assignment guidelines.

## Repository Structure
- **Source Files**: `prog_<q>.c` (where `<q>` is the question number, 1 to 8)
- **Documentation Files**: `doc_<q>.md` (Markdown documentation for each program)
- **README**: This file, providing an overview of the repository

## Tasks
1. **Parentheses Balance Checker**: Uses a stack to check if parentheses in a mathematical expression are balanced.
2. **Infix to Postfix Conversion and Evaluation**: Converts infix expressions to postfix and evaluates them using a stack.
3. **Linked List Reverse Traversal**: Implements recursive reverse traversal of a singly linked list.
4. **Doubly Linked List Operations**: Implements insertion and deletion in a doubly linked list.
5. **Graph Traversal**: Implements BFS and DFS for an undirected graph using an adjacency matrix.
6. **Min and Max Heap**: Builds min and max heaps from an unsorted array.
7. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths in a weighted graph from a source node.
8. **Sorting Algorithms**: Generates random integers, sorts them using user-selected algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge), and tracks comparisons/swaps.

## Compilation and Execution
- Compile each C program using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc prog_<q>.c -o prog_<q>`).
- Run the executable (e.g., `./prog_<q>`).
- Refer to `doc_<q>.md` for sample outputs and detailed explanations.

## Submission Details
- **Repository Name**: `dsa_assignment`
- **Version Control**: Commits made gradually with descriptive messages.
- **Academic Integrity**: All code and documentation are original, adhering to academic honesty standards.

## Notes
- Each program is modular, well-documented, and tested with provided or sample inputs.
- Documentation files (`doc_<q>.md`) include data structure definitions, function descriptions, main method organization, and sample outputs.

# DSA Assignment Repository

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for the **Data Structures and Algorithms (COMP202)** Assignment #2, June 2025. It includes C programs and their corresponding documentation for eight programming tasks, implemented as per the assignment guidelines.

## Repository Structure
- **Source Files**: `prog_<q>.c` (where `<q>` is the question number, 1 to 8)
- **Documentation Files**: `doc_<q>.md` (Markdown documentation for each program)
- **README**: This file, providing an overview of the repository

## Tasks
1. Write a program to check if any given mathematical expression ha balanced number of
parentheses or not?
Run the program by testing following expression-
⇒a + (b − c) ∗ (d
⇒m + [a − b ∗ (c + d ∗ {m)]
⇒a + (b − c)
Hint: Use stack
2. Write a program to convert an infix mathematical expression to postfix and evaluate it.
3. Write and Implement the reverse traversal algorithm in the the linked list. Write main() to
demonstrate the use of the function.
4. How can we implement the doubly linked list using structure? Write a method to insert(after
given node) and delete the node in doubly linked list. Write main() to demonstrate the use
of the functions.
5. How can we implement the undirected graph using adjacency matrix? Write a function that
implement the BFS and DFS technique to traverse through the graph. Demonstrate the
use of your program with example graph.
6. Given the array of the data (unsorted), Write a program to build the min and max heap.
7. Given a weighted graph, implement Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path from a
source node to all other nodes.
8. Write a program that generates a list of N random integers in the range [1, 1000], where N
is provided by the user at run time. Then, perform the following tasks:
(a) Ask the user to choose a sorting algorithm from the following:
• Bubble Sort
• Selection Sort
• Insertion Sort
• Merge Sort
(b) Sort the randomly generated numbers using the chosen algorithm.
(c) Print the numbers before and after sorting.
(d) Display the total number of comparisons and swaps (if applicable) performed by the
chosen algorithm.

## Notes
- Each program is modular, well-documented, and tested with provided or sample inputs.
- Documentation files (`doc_<q>.md`) include data structure definitions, function descriptions, main method organization, and sample outputs.
